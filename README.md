# Code Simplification Exercise

The code in the "app/shopping_mini.py" could use some love. Is it readable? Does it behave as desired? Your mission is to simplify the code and refactor into functions as necessary to produce the desired functionality.

## Desired functionality

For any list of selected products, the program should print a receipt and write the receipt to a file in the "receipts" directory.

This is an abbreviated version of the [Shopping Cart Project requirements](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/tree/master/projects/shopping-cart#basic-requirements).

## Setup

[Fork this repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/code-simplification-exercise-py), then clone your copy onto your local computer. Navigate here from the command-line.

```sh
cd code-simplification-py
```

From within the "base" anaconda environment or any other, run the script:

```sh
python app/shopping_mini.py
```
