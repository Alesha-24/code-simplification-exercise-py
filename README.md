# Code Simplification Exercise

The code in the "app/shopping_mini.py" could use some love. Is it readable? Does it behave as desired? Your mission is to simplify the code and refactor into functions as necessary to produce the desired functionality.

## Desired Functionality

This is an abbreviated version of the [Shopping Cart Project requirements](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/intro-to-python/tree/master/projects/shopping-cart#basic-requirements).

For any list of selected products, the program should:

  1. Calculate the total cost of goods sold, as well as tax owed and total amount owed.
  2. Print a receipt specifying the names and prices of all selected items, as well as the tax and total calculations.
  3. Write the same receipt information to a file in the "receipts" directory.

## Setup

[Fork this repo](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/code-simplification-exercise-py), then clone your copy onto your local computer. Navigate here from the command-line.

```sh
cd code-simplification-py
```

From within the "base" anaconda environment or any other, run the script:

```sh
python app/shopping_mini.py
```
